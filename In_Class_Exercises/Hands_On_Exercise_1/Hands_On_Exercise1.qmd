Getting Started

Install and launching R Packages

The code chunk below uses the p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
  library(pacman)
  pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

Importing the data

```{r}
```
