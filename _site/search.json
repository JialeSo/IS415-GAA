    "text": "The study of armed conflicts in Myanmar has gained critical importance in understanding the geographical distribution and intensity of violence across different regions. Myanmar’s complex ethnic composition and ongoing civil strife make it a unique case for geospatial analysis. This project aims to apply spatial and spatio-temporal point pattern analysis methods to uncover the patterns of armed conflict between January 2021 and June 2024.\nBy leveraging conflict data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) and geospatial tools, we will focus on visualizing and interpreting conflict density through heat maps, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and advanced spatio-temporal analysis.\n\nOur analysis will focus on four types of conflict events:\n\nBattles,\nExplosion/Remote violence,\nStrategic developments,\nViolence against civilians,\n\nwith particular attention paid to quarterly patterns in conflict occurrence."

    "text": "3.2 ACLED Data\n\n3.2.1 Changing the Column Names\nSince Myanmar’s regional hierarchy follows State, District, and Township levels, we will rename the columns accordingly:\n\nadmin1 → State\nadmin2 → District\nadmin3 → Township\n\nThis is important because different countries use different administrative hierarchies. For example, in Singapore, the hierarchy is organized by Region and Subzones. Adjusting these names ensures that our dataset aligns with Myanmar’s specific regional structure for accurate analysis.\n\nACLEDData_Cleanse &lt;- ACLEDData %&gt;%\n  select(event_id_cnty, event_date, year, disorder_type, event_type, actor1, inter1, \n         actor2, inter2, interaction, admin1, admin2, admin3, location, latitude, \n         longitude, fatalities) %&gt;%\n  rename(state = admin1, district = admin2, township = admin3) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ replace_na(.x, \"NA\")),  # Replace NA in character columns with \"NA\"\n         across(where(is.numeric), ~ replace_na(.x, 0)))  # Replace NA in numeric columns with 0\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Adding a “Quarter-Year” Column\nTo facilitate our temporal analysis, we need to add a “quarter-year” column based on the event_date field. This can be done by adjusting the date format to represent the quarter and year, ensuring that each event is categorized by the specific quarter it occurred in (e.g., Q1-2021, Q2-2022). This will allow for easier analysis of conflict trends over time.\n\n# Convert event_date to Date format (if it's not already a date)\nACLEDData_Cleanse$event_date &lt;- as.Date(ACLEDData_Cleanse$event_date, format=\"%d-%b-%y\")  # Adjust the format if needed\n# Add a new column that shows the quarter and year\nACLEDData_Cleanse &lt;- ACLEDData_Cleanse %&gt;%\n  mutate(quarter_year = paste0(\"Q\", quarter(event_date), \"-\", year(event_date)))\n\nhead(ACLEDData_Cleanse)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 18\n  event_id_cnty event_date  year disorder_type   event_type actor1 inter1 actor2\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 MMR64313      2024-06-30  2024 Political viol… Battles    Peopl…      3 Milit…\n2 MMR64320      2024-06-30  2024 Political viol… Battles    Peopl…      3 Milit…\n3 MMR64321      2024-06-30  2024 Political viol… Battles    Peopl…      3 Milit…\n4 MMR64322      2024-06-30  2024 Strategic deve… Strategic… Milit…      1 NA    \n5 MMR64323      2024-06-30  2024 Political viol… Battles    PKDF …      3 Milit…\n6 MMR64324      2024-06-30  2024 Strategic deve… Strategic… Milit…      1 NA    \n# ℹ 10 more variables: inter2 &lt;dbl&gt;, interaction &lt;dbl&gt;, state &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   district &lt;chr&gt;, township &lt;chr&gt;, location &lt;chr&gt;, latitude &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   longitude &lt;dbl&gt;, fatalities &lt;dbl&gt;, quarter_year &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Joining ACLED’s Codebook Description\nACLED’s stores their data for the column “interaction” and “inter1” and “inter2” in codes, using their code book, let’s reorganise their data for simplier view, we can reference the code book here to know what each code represent.

We are uncertain how ACLED assigns these regions, so to ensure consistency, we remove the original state and district columns from the ACLED data and replace them with the geolocated values.\nSteps:\n\nConvert ACLED Data to an SF Object: Using longitude and latitude coordinates, transform the ACLED dataset into a spatial object. Remember thatt we have to set CRS 32647 here as well.\nPerform a Spatial Join: Match the points from ACLED with the corresponding state and district boundaries from the m_sf shapefile, selecting only those columns.\nRemove Original Columns: After the spatial join, drop the original state, district, and township columns from the ACLED dataset.\nRename the Joined Columns: Rename the newly joined state.y and district.y to state and district, effectively replacing the original columns with the reverse-geolocated values.\n\n\n# Step 1: Convert ACLEDDataCleanse to an sf object using longitude and latitude\nACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf &lt;- st_as_sf(ACLEDData_Cleanse, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)\n\n# Step 2: Transform ACLEDDataCleanse_sf to the same CRS as m_sf (EPSG: 32647)\nACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf &lt;- st_transform(ACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf, crs = 32647)\n\n# Step 3: Perform a spatial join, selecting only the state and district from m_sf\nreverse_geolocated_state &lt;- st_join(ACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf, M_State_Sf_Cleansed[, c(\"state\")], join = st_intersects)\n\n# Step 2: Spatial join to add 'district' from M_District_Sf_Cleansed\nreverse_geolocated_district &lt;- st_join(reverse_geolocated_state, M_District_Sf_Cleansed[, c(\"district\")], join = st_intersects)\n\n# Step 3: Remove original 'state', 'district', and 'township' columns from ACLEDData_Cleanse (if they exist)\n# This step removes the original columns, and then renames the newly joined columns\nACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf &lt;- reverse_geolocated_district %&gt;%\n  select(-contains(\"state.x\"), -contains(\"district.x\"), -contains(\"township\")) %&gt;%  # Remove old state, district, township columns\n  rename(state = state.y, district = district.y)  # Rename newly joined columns\n\nACLEDData_Cleanse &lt;- st_drop_geometry(ACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf)\n\n# View the updated data\nprint(ACLEDData_Cleanse_Sf)\n\nSimple feature collection with 42608 features and 20 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -208804.4 ymin: 1103500 xmax: 640934.5 ymax: 3042960\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 47N\n# A tibble: 42,608 × 21\n   event_id_cnty event_date  year disorder_type  event_type actor1 inter1 actor2\n   &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "4.1 Aggregation of Data for exploratory purposes\nStep 1: Filter Data for Civilians\nIn this first step, the data (ACLEDData_Cleanse) is filtered so that only rows where either “Civilians” are involved in the conflict (inter1_description or inter2_description) are kept. Additionally, rows where the state information is missing (NA) are removed because these conflicts can’t be assigned to a specific geographical area.\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- ACLEDData_Cleanse %&gt;%\n  filter((inter1_description == \"Civilians\" | inter2_description == \"Civilians\") & !is.na(state))\n\nStep 2: Calculate State Area in Square Kilometers\nNext, the code calculates the area for each state from the M_State_Sf_Cleansed spatial dataset. The st_area function retrieves the area in square meters, and dividing by 1 million (1e6) converts it into square kilometers. This information will be used later to calculate conflict and fatality density.\n\nstate_area_km2 &lt;- st_area(M_State_Sf_Cleansed) / 1e6\nstate_area_df &lt;- data.frame(state = M_State_Sf_Cleansed$state, area_km2 = as.numeric(state_area_km2))\n\nStep 3: Aggregate Total Conflicts and Fatalities by State\nThe next step is to group the filtered data by state and calculate two key metrics: the total number of conflicts and the total number of fatalities for each state. This is done using group_by and summarise.\n\nagg_data_by_state &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(state) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_conflicts = n(), \n    total_fatalities = sum(fatalities, na.rm = TRUE), \n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\nStep 4: Convert to Non-Spatial Data Frame\nHere, the spatial data is converted into a regular data frame by dropping the geometry information. This allows easier manipulation of the non-spatial data for further processing.\n\nfiltered_data_df &lt;- st_drop_geometry(filtered_data)\n\nStep 5: Prepare Data Frame for Yearly Data\nTo store yearly conflict and fatality data for each state, an empty data frame is initialized by selecting distinct states from the filtered data\n\nfinal_result &lt;- filtered_data_df %&gt;% select(state) %&gt;% distinct()\n\nStep 6: Loop Through Each Year and Calculate Yearly Conflicts/Fatalities\nIn this step, the code iterates over each unique year in the dataset. For each year, it calculates the total conflicts and fatalities for each state. The results are merged back into the final_result data frame, with columns named according to the year (e.g., conflicts_2021, fatalities_2021).\n\nunique_years &lt;- unique(filtered_data_df$year)\n\nfor (yr in unique_years) {\n  yearly_data &lt;- filtered_data_df %&gt;%\n    filter(year == yr) %&gt;%\n    group_by(state) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      conflicts = n(), \n      fatalities = sum(fatalities, na.rm = TRUE)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    rename_at(vars(conflicts, fatalities), ~ paste0(., \"_\", yr))  # Rename with year\n  \n  final_result &lt;- left_join(final_result, yearly_data, by = \"state\")\n}\n\nStep 7: Replace NAs with 0\nAny missing data for a state-year combination (e.g., a state with no conflicts in a particular year) is replaced with 0 to avoid leaving gaps in the analysis.\n\nfinal_result &lt;- final_result %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .)))\n\nStep 8: Calculate Conflict and Fatality Density\nNow, the code calculates the density of conflicts and fatalities per square kilometer for each state. The results from Step 3 (agg_data_by_state) are joined with the state area data from Step 2. The density is simply the number of conflicts or fatalities divided by the area in square kilometers.\n\nagg_data_with_density &lt;- agg_data_by_state %&gt;%\n  left_join(state_area_df, by = \"state\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    conflict_density = total_conflicts / area_km2,\n    fatality_density = total_fatalities / area_km2\n  )\n\nStep 9: Merge Yearly Data and Density with Spatial Data\nFinally, the spatial data (M_State_Sf_Cleansed) is merged with the yearly conflict/fatality data (final_result) and the density data (agg_data_with_density). Additional calculations are made to find the fatality-per-conflict ratio which are then added to the final spatial dataset.\n\nfinalized_map &lt;- M_State_Sf_Cleansed %&gt;%\n  left_join(final_result, by = \"state\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(agg_data_with_density, by = \"state\")\n\nfinalized_map &lt;- finalized_map %&gt;%\n  mutate(conflict_fatality_ratio = ifelse(total_fatalities == 0, NA, total_fatalities / total_conflicts))\n\nfinalized_map &lt;- finalized_map %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    fatality_per_conflict = ifelse(total_conflicts == 0, NA, total_fatalities / total_conflicts),\n  )\n\nfinalized_map &lt;- finalized_map %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    rank_total_conflicts = rank(-total_conflicts, ties.method = \"min\"),  #

However, I would like to focus on the central question:\nWhich state has the highest amount of conflict and fatality density?\nBy using density, I’ve aimed to assess fatalities in relation to conflicts and ensure a fair comparison by adjusting for density.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, this is not the most precise analysis, as other factors—such as ethnicity, population demographics, and gender—could also be considered. However, for the purpose of this study, I have chosen to focus on solely on the state’s conflict and fatality density.\n\n\nConflict Density: This is the number of conflicts per square kilometer in a state.\n\nConflict Density=Total ConflictsArea of State (km²) = Conflict Density=Area of State (km²)Total Conflicts​\nThis tells you how many conflicts occur per unit of area (1 km²) in each state.\nFatality Density: This is the number of fatalities per square kilometer.\nFatality Density=Total FatalitiesArea of State (km²) = Fatality Density=Area of State (km²)Total Fatalities​\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Viewing the top 3 states across\nUsing the map below, you can interactively explore the Conflict and Fatality Density.

Although it is no longer the political capital, Yangon holds the highest population density in the country, making it a vital urban center with significant influence.\nAccording to the data, Yangon ranks 5th for total conflicts, with 1,489 civilian conflicts reported, and 8th in fatalities, with 431 deaths. However, it stands out with the highest civilian conflict density (0.0531) and fatality density (0.01536) among Myanmar’s 15 states. This means that while the overall number of conflicts may not be the highest, they are more concentrated within Yangon’s urban area, resulting in the highest per-unit area conflict rate.\nYangon’s urbanization and strategic economic importance likely make it a hotspot for civilian unrest. Social tensions in a densely populated city lead to frequent conflicts, reflected in its rank of 1st for conflict density and fatality density. Despite fewer total conflicts compared to other states, Yangon’s density of unrest highlights its vulnerability to civil tensions.\n\n\n4.3.3.2 Mandalay\n\nMandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, is known for its cultural significance and central location in the country. It holds a key strategic position in the economy and transportation networks, making it vulnerable to unrest.\nThe data shows Mandalay ranks 2nd for total civilian conflicts with 2,021 conflicts and 950 fatalities. Its civilian conflict density is 0.0255, placing it 3rd in density, while its fatality density is 0.0120, ranked 2nd. Despite being second in conflict counts, the concentration of conflicts and fatalities suggests that civil unrest is deeply rooted in the region, but not as dense as in Yangon.\nMandalay’s high fatality-to-conflict ratio (0.4701 fatalities per conflict) highlights the deadly nature of conflicts, ranking 7th in fatalities per conflict. This reflects a region where conflicts, though frequent, lead to significant loss of life compared to other states.\n\n\n4.3.3.3 Sagaling.\n\nSagaing, located in northern Myanmar, is one of the country’s most conflict-ridden regions, often affected by armed insurgencies and ethnic clashes due to its proximity to volatile borders.\nThe data reveals that Sagaing ranks 1st in total civilian conflicts with 5,346 conflicts and 3,319 fatalities, giving it the highest fatality count as well. However, its civilian conflict density is 0.0241 (ranked 3rd) and its fatality density is 0.01497 (ranked 3rd), indicating a widespread yet slightly less concentrated conflict zone compared to Yangon and Mandalay.\nSagaing’s fatality per civilian conflict ratio of 0.6208 ranks 2nd, emphasizing the high lethality of conflicts in the region. With both the largest number of conflicts and a high fatality rate, Sagaing represents one of the most dangerous and unstable areas in Myanmar for civilians/"

    "text": "4.4 Final Round of Cleansing ACLED Data\nIn this final stage of the data cleansing process, we focus on preparing the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) for the different states. The key steps include:\n\nFiltering: We first filter the dataset to focus on data specific to Yangon.\nConverting to Spatial Format: Using the st_as_sf() function, we transform the filtered data into a simple features (sf) object, a format commonly used for spatial data in R. This involves specifying longitude and latitude as the coordinates and setting the correct WGS84 (CRS 4326) coordinate system for global geographic data.\nCoordinate System Transformation: We apply the st_transform() function to project the spatial data from WGS84 (CRS 4326) to UTM Zone 47N (CRS 32647), which is more appropriate for spatial analysis in Myanmar. This step ensures accurate distance and area calculations.\nValidity Check: Using st_is_valid(), we validate the geometries in the spatial data to ensure there are no invalid shapes, such as self-intersecting polygons, which could cause errors during analysis.\nConversion to Spatial Data Frame: Finally, we convert the sf object into a Spatial Data Frame (as_Spatial()) for compatibility with specific spatial analysis functions that require this format.\n\nThis process ensures that the States data is accurately represented in a geospatial format, with proper coordinate transformation and validity checks applied. It prepares the data for further geospatial operations, such as mapping and spatial pattern analysis, with the confidence that the dataset is clean and valid for use.\n\nYangonMandalaySagaing\n\n\n\n# Filter data for Yangon state from the entire ACLED dataset\nYangon_ACLED_Data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;% \n  filter(state %in% c(\"Yangon\"))\n\n# Check the class of the data to confirm it's a dataframe\nclass(Yangon_ACLED_Data)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n# Convert the filtered data into a spatial format (simple features object)\n# Use longitude and latitude columns as coordinates, with WGS84 (CRS 4326) as the coordinate system\nYangon_ACLED_Data_Sf &lt;- st_as_sf(Yangon_ACLED_Data, coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)\n\n# Transform the coordinate system to UTM Zone 47N (CRS 32647) for better spatial precision in Myanmar\nYangon_ACLED_Data_Sf &lt;- st_transform(Yangon_ACLED_Data_Sf, crs = 32647)\n\n# Check the class of the spatial object to confirm conversion\nclass(Yangon_ACLED_Data_Sf)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n# Validate the spatial object to ensure all geometries are valid (no broken or self-intersecting geometries)\nYangon_ACLED_Validity &lt;- st_is_valid(Yangon_ACLED_Data_Sf)\n\n# Identify any invalid geometries and print them if they exist\nYangon_invalid &lt;- which(!Yangon_ACLED_Validity)\nif (length(Yangon_invalid) &gt;

The Epanechnikov kernel minimizes error and focuses on areas with higher density, effectively capturing conflict hotspots while reducing the impact of outliers.\nKey Observations:\n\nCentral Yangon Hotspot: Conflict density remains consistently high in central Yangon throughout the period.\nTemporal Shifts: Conflict intensity fluctuates across quarters, peaking in certain periods (e.g., Q3-2022 and Q1-2024), with some spread into surrounding areas over time.\nDensity Spread: While central areas remain the most affected, the gradual spread suggests an intensification or expansion of conflicts.\n\nIn summary, Scott’s bandwidth and the Epanechnikov kernel provided a precise view of conflict clustering and temporal changes, revealing critical patterns in civilian-related conflict hotspots in Yangon.\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Mandalay\n\n7.3.2.1 Mandalay Kernel 1: Gaussian Kernel\n\nDiggleScottCvLPPL\n\n\n\nMandalay_Results_Diggle_Gaussian &lt;- process_quarter_conflicts(\n  region_sf = Mandalay_Sf,\n  region_window = Mandalay_Owin,\n  region_name = \"Mandalay\",\n  data_sf = Mandalay_ACLED_Data_Sf,\n  sigma_type = \"diggle\",  #

The kernel effectively focuses on dense areas, capturing conflict intensity over time without distortion from outliers.\nKey Observations:\n\nCentral Mandalay Hotspot: Consistent conflict density is observed in central Mandalay across all quarters, with peaks in Q3-2022 and Q1-2023.\nSpatiotemporal Patterns: Conflict density fluctuates quarter by quarter, with spread toward the north in several periods, indicating shifts in conflict zones.\nStability vs Spread: While central Mandalay remains a key hotspot, the spread of conflicts over time suggests areas of emerging concern.\n\nThis KDE approach reveals both stable hotspots and the evolving nature of conflicts in Mandalay, providing insights into the intensity and movement of conflict zones across different periods.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Sagaing\n\n7.3.3.1 Sagaing Kernel 1: Gaussian Kernel\n\nDiggleScottCvLPPL\n\n\n\nSagaing_Results_Diggle_Gaussian &lt;- process_quarter_conflicts(\n  region_sf = Sagaing_Sf,\n  region_window = Sagaing_Owin,\n  region_name = \"Sagaing\",\n  data_sf = Sagaing_ACLED_Data_Sf,\n  sigma_type = \"diggle\",  #

This method ensures that key dense areas are well-represented while minimizing the impact of noise from less significant areas.\nKey Observations:\n\nConsistent Hotspot: The southern region of Sagaing consistently shows high-density conflict areas throughout the quarters, especially peaking during Q3-2022 and Q1-2023.\nEmerging Zones: Some quarters, such as Q1-2022 and Q3-2023, show increased conflict spread to the north, indicating a potential shift in conflict locations.\nStability and Peaks: The core conflict areas maintain their intensity, while certain periods experience an expansion of conflict areas, with a notable rise in density during the mid-2022 period.\n\nThese patterns highlight that conflict zones in Sagaing are relatively stable with periods of increased intensity, particularly in southern areas. This provides critical insights into when and where civilian conflict events have intensified."

The R-value is less than 1, and the p-value is very small, which means the conflict events in Sagaing are not randomly distributed and are significantly clustered.\n\nK-function Analysis:\n\n\nThe observed K-function consistently exceeds the upper bound of the CSR envelope across all distances, indicating that the clustering is prominent over a wide range of distances (up to 70km). The clustering becomes more pronounced as the distance increases.\n\nL-function Analysis:\n\n\nThe observed L-function also exceeds the CSR envelope’s upper bounds, confirming the presence of clustering at multiple spatial scales. This supports the findings from the K-function.\n\nObserved Tables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance\nK_Obs\nK_Lo\nK_Hi\nL_Obs\nL_Lo\nL_Hi\n\n\n\n\n19.99394\n7021.421\n1186.336\n1325.415\n19.81300\n20.17488\n20.17488\n\n\n29.99091\n12903.634\n2756.181\n2895.260\n64.08864\n29.80997\n30.17185\n\n\n39.98788\n19530.590\n4963.964\n5093.043\n78.84656\n39.80694\n40.16882\n\n\n49.98485\n26873.240\n7797.685\n7916.764\n92.48793\n49.80391\n50.16579\n\n\n59.98182\n34286.168\n11233.343\n11372.422\n104.46830\n59.80088\n60.16277\n\n\n68.24599\n40939.246\n1456,475\n14701.554\n114.15501\n68.06505\n68.4269\n\n\n\n\nThe observed K-function and L-function tables confirm that the observed values are significantly higher than the expected values under CSR, particularly at distances of 20km, 30km, 40km, and beyond, suggesting clustering at larger spatial scales.\n\nWe reject the null hypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR) for Sagaing civilian-related conflicts. The Clark-Evans test shows significant clustering, and both the K-function and L-function support this finding by indicating clustering over a broad range of distances. The observed tables further confirm this, as the observed values consistently exceed the CSR bounds. Therefore, the conflict events in Sagaing are significantly clustered rather than randomly distributed."

The high-intensity zones shrink, but they consistently appear in similar locations, suggesting that while the scale of conflict has reduced, these areas remain focal points for civilian conflict.\n\nThe persistent clustering, even as intensity diminishes, indicates that certain regions continue to experience conflicts, requiring targeted interventions in those zones."

This indicates that although conflict intensity is declining, these areas continue to be hotspots for civilian conflict.\n\nThus, the persistence of clustering in the same areas despite decreasing conflict intensity highlights the need for focused intervention strategies in these conflict-prone regions."

These regions show recurring intensity, highlighting persistent conflict zones.\nTemporal Fluctuations: Some quarters, such as 20212, 20213, and 20222, exhibit relatively lower conflict intensity, while 20224 shows a resurgence in intensity.\nLocalized Hotspots: The southern region shows a spike in density during 20241, followed by a steady reduction in the later quarters.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThere is ongoing clustering in the same geographic regions of Sagaing, with peaks of conflict intensity in specific quarters. This indicates that while the overall distribution of conflicts remains stable, certain periods witness heightened violence."

The observed K-function shows less deviation from the CSR envelope, indicating that the spatial clustering effect is declining as we compare events separated by more time.\n\n\n\n10.1.2.1.4 2022 vs 2023\n\n\nThe K-function here indicates significant clustering at smaller distances, but the intensity decreases more rapidly beyond 15 km.\nThe spatial clustering between 2022 and 2023 is still present but somewhat weaker compared to other year-pair comparisons.\n\n\n\n10.1.2.1.5 2022 vs 2024\n\n\nThe 2022 vs 2024 K-function shows clustering, though it is less pronounced than in the previous year comparisons.\nThe clustering effect diminishes as the events from these two years become more spatially dispersed, particularly beyond 15 km.\n\n\n\n10.1.2.1.6 2023 vs 2024\n\n\nThe K-function for 2023 vs 2024 shows the least clustering effect of all the comparisons.\nThere is minimal deviation from the CSR line, indicating that the events from these two years are closer to being randomly distributed, with only mild clustering observed at smaller distances.\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2.1 Overall Years Comparison\n\nClustering is strongest between events that are closer in time (e.g., 2021 vs 2022), with the strength of clustering generally decreasing as the time difference between events increases (e.g., 2021 vs 2024).\nThis suggests that civilian conflict events in Yangon have a spatial-temporal dependence, where events in one year are more likely to occur near events from the following year, but this effect diminishes over time."

The observed K-function is consistently above the CSR envelope, indicating that conflict events from 2021 tend to cluster near those from 2022.\nThe clustering effect appears to intensify as the distance increases, suggesting a broad spatial clustering pattern for conflicts in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\n10.2.2.1.2 2021 vs 2023\n\n\nthe K-function for 2021 vs 2023 also shows clustering, but it is slightly less pronounced than in the 2021 vs 2022 comparison.\nThe clustering becomes more noticeable at distances beyond 10 km, implying that conflict events from these two years tend to cluster over medium to larger distances.\nHowever, the clustering effect weakens somewhat compared to the previous year comparison.\n\n\n\n10.2.2.1.3 2021 vs 2024\n\n\nClustering between 2021 and 2024 is still present, but the intensity is weaker compared to the previous year pairs.\nThe observed K-function does show some clustering above the CSR line, but the deviation from randomness is smaller, suggesting that events from 2021 and 2024 are less spatially related than the closer years (2021 vs 2022).\n\n\n\n10.2.2.1.4 2022 vs 2023\n\n\nThe clustering between 2022 and 2023 remains significant, especially at larger distances, with the observed K-function clearly above the CSR envelope.\nSimilar to earlier comparisons, this suggests that conflict events from these two years cluster over wider distances, continuing the spatial clustering trend seen in other comparisons.\n\n\n\n10.2.2.5 2022 vs 2024\n\n\nThe 2022 vs 2024 K-function shows clustering, although the intensity is weaker, particularly at smaller distances.\nThere is a slight increase in clustering at larger distances, but the deviation from the CSR envelope is less pronounced compared to the earlier year comparisons.\n\n\n\n10.2.2.6 2023 vs 2024\n\n\nThe K-function for 2023 vs 2024 shows clustering, though this is the weakest of all the comparisons.\nThe clustering effect becomes more noticeable at distances greater than 10 km, but overall, the spatial relationship between events from 2023 and 2024 is closer to random compared to earlier year comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2.1 Mandalay Overall Years Comparison\n\nSimilar to the Yangon analysis, the spatial clustering is strongest between conflict events that are closer in time, such as 2021 vs 2022 and 2022 vs 2023.\nAs the time gap between years increases, the clustering effect becomes weaker, with the least clustering observed between 2023 and 2024.\n\nThese results suggest that conflicts in Mandalay show spatio-temporal clustering, with events from one year often clustering near those from the next, but this effect diminishes as the time gap between years grows."

This indicates that the conflict events in 2021 and 2022 are significantly clustered in space. The clustering effect becomes more pronounced at larger distances, especially after 20 km.\nThe trans K-function also follows a similar pattern, showing clustering beyond the expected CSR pattern.\nThe Kbord function demonstrates that boundary corrections had minimal impact on the general clustering trends observed.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1.2 2021 vs 2023\n\n\nSimilar to the comparison between 2021 and 2022, the K-function in 2021 vs 2023 also shows a high degree of clustering, with obs(r) being higher than CSR across nearly all distances.\nThere is a slightly more pronounced clustering effect around 30 to 40 km, where the gap between the observed K and CSR becomes wider. This suggests an increase in conflict density over time.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1.3 2021 vs 2024\n\n\nthe K-function for 2021 vs 2024 shows a consistent pattern of clustering across distances, although the observed values tend to rise more sharply after 40 km, indicating that conflicts in 2024 were more dispersed initially but clustered significantly at larger spatial scales.\nThe results suggest that the spatial distribution of conflicts in 2024 is slightly different, possibly influenced by external factors that caused conflicts to be more spread out in space.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1.4 2022 vs 2023\n\n\nThe comparison between 2022 and 2024 reveals strong clustering over a wide range of distances, with significant increases after 30 km.\nThis suggests that conflicts in 2024 are more spatially concentrated at larger distances compared to 2022.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1.5 2022 vs 2024\n\n\nThe comparison between 2022 and 2024 reveals strong clustering over a wide range of distances, with significant increases after 30 km.\nThis suggests that conflicts in 2024 are more spatially concentrated at larger distances compared to 2022.\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1.6 2023 vs 2024\n\n\nThe clustering trend continues between 2023 and 2024, with notable increases in clustering beyond 40 km. The gap between the observed K and CSR remains large, indicating that the conflict events in 2023 and 2024 were not randomly distributed but exhibited significant spatial clustering.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.2.1 Sagaing Overall Years Comparison\n\nAcross all years (2021-2024), the K-functions suggest that civilian-related conflict events in Sagaing are significantly clustered rather than randomly distributed. The degree of clustering varies slightly across the years, with some years (such as 2024) showing stronger clustering at larger distances (over 40 km). This indicates that the conflict dynamics in Sagaing are evolving over time, possibly due to changes in political, social, or environmental factors."

    "text": "Drug abuse remains a global concern, with its impact ranging from deteriorating public health to increasing crime rates and economic instability. According to global reports, in 2021, 1 in 17 people aged 15–64 used drugs within the past year. Despite concerted efforts to combat drug trafficking and abuse, the numbers continue to rise, with drug consumption growing from 240 million users in 2011 to 296 million in 2021.\nThailand, geographically located near the infamous Golden Triangle—one of the largest illicit drug production regions in the world—faces its own drug crisis. This region’s proximity to Thailand, coupled with well-developed transportation networks, makes the country not only a prime target for drug trafficking but also a transit hub for drugs en route to third countries. As a result, drug abuse within Thailand has become a pressing issue, especially among youth populations. It is estimated that there are 2.7 million youths in Thailand involved with drugs, with vocational students representing a significant portion of these users.\nThe objective of this analysis is to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of drug abuse across Thailand at the province level. By utilizing geospatial analysis methods, this report aims to answer three key questions:\n\nAre the indicators of drug abuse in Thailand spatially independent or spatially dependent?\nWhere are the clusters, outliers, and hotspots of drug abuse across Thailand’s provinces?\nHow do these patterns evolve over time, and what correlations exist between drug abuse and socio-economic factors such as education levels and unemployment rates?\n\nUnderstanding these patterns will provide key insights into where resources and interventions should be targeted to combat drug abuse effectively."

    "text": "A spatio-temporal point process (also called space-time or spatial-temporal point process) is a random collection of points, where each point represents the time and location of an event. Examples of events include incidence of disease, sightings or births of a species, or the occurrences of fires, earthquakes, lightning strikes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions.\nThe analysis of spatio-temporal point patterns is becoming increasingly necessary, given the rapid emergence of geographically and temporally indexed data in a wide range of fields. Several spatio-temporal point patterns analysis methods have been introduced and implemented in R in the last ten years. This chapter shows how various R packages can be combined to run a set of spatio-temporal point pattern analyses in a guided and intuitive way. A real world forest fire events in Kepulauan Bangka Belitung, Indonesia from 1st January 2023 to 31st December 2023 is used to illustrate the methods, procedures and interpretations.\n\n\nThe specific question we would like to answer is:\n\nare the locations of forest fire in Kepulauan Bangka Belitung spatial and spatio-temporally independent?\nif the answer is NO, where and when the observed forest fire locations tend to cluster?"

    "text": "3.2 Initial Exploration\nBefore we begin the spatial analysis, it is essential to explore and prepare the datasets to ensure they are ready for analysis. This includes checking for missing values, merging datasets, and creating visualizations to understand the general patterns of drug abuse across provinces.\n\nPreviewing the Spatial Data: We start by loading the shapefile to confirm that all provinces are represented and the boundaries are correct. This spatial dataset will form the backbone of the analysis, providing the geographical context for our study.\nCleaning and Aggregating: Any missing or erroneous data is cleaned, and the data is aggregated at the province level if needed. This ensures that the dataset is consistent and ready for analysis.\nSummary Statistics: We generate summary statistics for key variables, such as the average drug abuse rate across provinces, the distribution of education levels, and unemployment rates. This gives us a preliminary understanding of the data distribution before we move into more detailed spatial analysis."

A low p-value (&lt; 0.05) suggests that the observed clustering is unlikely to have occurred by random chance.\nThe p-values remained low and stable throughout the period, indicating that the spatial clustering of drug cases is statistically significant across all years analyzed.\n\nTrends and Insights:\n\nThe upward trend in Moran’s I values over the years highlights increasing clustering of drug cases, particularly in 2022. This suggests that certain provinces may be experiencing more significant drug-related issues than others.\nThe stable low p-values reinforce the reliability of the findings, indicating consistent spatial autocorrelation throughout the study period."

    "text": "7.2 Local Moran’s I Over Multiple Years\nWhile analyzing the total density of drug cases across provinces provides valuable insights, it’s also crucial to consider how these patterns change over time. By examining Local Moran’s I for each year from 2017 to 2022, we can uncover temporal trends in the clustering of drug cases, which may indicate emerging hotspots or shifts in drug-related activity across different periods.\nThe process for analyzing drug-related incidents over multiple years follows the same approach we used for the total density of cases. We calculate Local Moran’s I for each year individually, applying the same statistical consistency, and using the median to handle any skewness in the data. This ensures we maintain a robust analysis across different time frames.\n\n7.2.1 Prepping the data across.\nBy looping through each year from 2017 to 2022, we compute Local Moran’s I for each year’s drug cases per square kilometer. For each year, we extract the p_ii_sim values to determine the statistical significance of clusters and use the median to capture the central tendency of clustering patterns.\nThis step helps us track how spatial clustering of drug cases evolves over time. It enables us to answer key questions, such as whether the same regions consistently exhibit significant clustering (whether high-high or low-low), or if new hotspots have emerged in recent years. By focusing on p_ii_sim values and the median, we ensure consistency and reliability in the temporal analysis, which will allow us to plot time-based charts and compare year-on-year trends.\nUltimately, analyzing drug case clustering over time provides a more dynamic and comprehensive view of the drug situation in Thailand. It enables policymakers to not only respond to current hotspots but also to anticipate emerging trends and allocate resources accordingly to prevent escalation in regions showing increasing clustering patterns.\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n# Loop through each year to calculate p_ii_sim and median\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Construct the year-specific variable names\n  year_column &lt;- paste0(\"Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_\", year)\n  \n  # Calculate local Moran's I for the current year\n  LISA &lt;- thailand_province_final_sf %&gt;%\n    mutate(local_moran = local_moran(\n      !!sym(year_column),  # Use !!sym() to handle dynamic column names\n      nb,\n      wt,\n      nsim = 999\n    )) %&gt;%\n    unnest(local_moran)\n  \n  # Extract p_ii_sim and median from LISA\n  p_ii_sim_values &lt;- LISA$p_ii_sim  # Get all p_ii_sim values for the year\n  median_values &lt;- LISA$median       # Get all median values for the year \n  \n  # Add new columns to the existing LISA_TotalDensity data frame\n  LISA_TotalDensity &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n    mutate(!!paste0(\"p_ii_sim_\", year) := p_ii_sim_values,\n           !!paste0(\"median_\", year) := median_values)\n}\n# Print the resulting LISA_TotalDensity data frame\nprint(LISA_TotalDensity)\n\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 57 fields\nGeometry type: GEOMETRY\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 325178.8 ymin: 620865.7 xmax: 1213656 ymax: 2263213\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 47N\n# A tibble: 77 × 58\n   Province                TotalCases Area_km2 Drugs_Cases_2017 Drugs_Cases_2018\n * &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 BANGKOK                      65522    1571.            11871            16480\n 2 SAMUT PRAKAN                 14721     949.              820             3015\n 3 NONTHABURI                    8881     636.              553             1661\n 4 PATHUM THANI                  9805    1517.              450             1823\n 5 PHRA NAKHON SI AYUTTHA…       8780    2553.              378             1123\n 6 ANG THONG                     3487     944.              208              660\n 7 LOP BURI                      9236    6493.              727             1850\n 8 SING BURI                     2596     818.              127              402\n 9 CHAI NAT                      3781    2485.              200              422\n10 SARABURI                      4229    3483.               69              628\n# ℹ 67 more rows\n# ℹ 53 more variables: Drugs_Cases_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;, TotalDensity &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2017 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Rank_TotalCases &lt;int&gt;, Rank_TotalDensity &lt;int&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Visualizing the chart Local Moran Across different years\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n\n# Create an empty list to store individual maps\nmap_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through each year to create maps for significant clusters\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Filter significant clusters for the current year\n  LISA_Sig &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n    filter(!!sym(paste0(\"p_ii_sim_\", year)) &lt; 0.05)  # Filter for significance\n\n  # Create the map for significant clusters for the current year\n  map &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n    tm_shape(LISA_Sig) +\n    tm_fill(paste0(\"median_\", year), alpha = 0.7) + \n    tm_borders(col = \"darkblue\", alpha = 0.4) +\n    tm_layout(main.title = paste(\"Significant Clusters of Local Moran's I -\", year),\n              main.title.size = 1.2,\n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n    tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8))\n\n  # Store the current map in the list\n  map_list[[as.character(year)]] &lt;- map\n}\n\n# Combine all maps into one layout\ncombined_map &lt;- do.call(tmap_arrange, c(map_list, ncol = 3))\n\n# Print the combined map\nprint(combined_map)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this analysis, we are generating a 3x2 grid of maps that will allow us to compare the significant clusters of Local Moran’s I across the years from 2017 to 2022. Each map will focus on displaying the provinces where drug-related incidents exhibit statistically significant spatial clustering patterns for that specific year, ensuring that only meaningful and significant data is highlighted.\nFor each year, we filter the data to include only clusters that have p-values less than 0.05, meaning they are statistically significant. This ensures that the clusters we observe represent genuine spatial patterns rather than random variations. By mapping these clusters across multiple years, we can visually compare the changes and consistency in spatial clustering over time.\n\nThe maps are arranged in a 3x2 layout to make it easy to view and compare the data for each year side by side. This layout helps us observe how the spatial distribution of drug cases evolves, whether the same regions continue to show significant clustering year after year, or if new areas emerge as hotspots.\nEach map will include visual indicators for the median values of Local Moran’s I, ensuring consistency in the method used to analyze and display the clustering data. This also helps us maintain uniformity in the interpretation across different years.\n\nThis comparative analysis is useful for policymakers, as it highlights temporal trends in drug-related incidents. By visualizing significant clusters over time, it becomes easier to pinpoint persistent problem areas or identify emerging regions of concern, helping to inform more targeted and timely interventions.\n\n7.2.2.1 Animation across years\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n\n# Set tmap mode to plot (for static rendering)\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n# Create an empty list to store individual frames\nmap_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through each year to create maps for significant clusters\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Filter significant clusters for the current year\n  LISA_Sig &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n    filter(!!sym(paste0(\"p_ii_sim_\", year)) &lt; 0.05)  # Filter for significance\n\n  # Create the map for the current year\n  map &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n    tm_shape(LISA_Sig) +\n    tm_fill(paste0(\"median_\", year), alpha = 0.7) + \n    tm_borders(col = \"darkblue\", alpha = 0.4) +\n    tm_layout(main.title = paste(\"Significant Clusters of Local Moran's I -\", year),\n              main.title.size = 0.8,\n              legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n    tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8))\n\n  # Store the current map in the list\n  map_list[[as.character(year)]] &lt;- map\n}\n\n# Create an animated GIF by saving each map as a frame\ntmap_animation(\n  map_list, \n  filename = \"LISA_Animation.gif\", \n  delay = 100,  # Delay between frames in milliseconds\n  width = 800, \n  height = 600\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Multi-Year Drug Case Density Analysis\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n\n# Create an empty list to store individual bar charts\nplot_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through each year to create a bar chart for significant clusters\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Filter data for the current year\n  LISA_Sig &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n    st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # Remove geometry column\n    filter(!!sym(paste0(\"p_ii_sim_\", year)) &lt; 0.05) %&gt;%  # Filter significant clusters\n    select(Province, \n           median = !!sym(paste0(\"median_\", year)), \n           Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2 = !!sym(paste0(\"Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_\", year)))  # Select relevant columns\n\n  # Create a bar chart for the current year\n  plot &lt;- ggplot(LISA_Sig, aes(x = reorder(Province, -Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2), y = Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2, fill = as.factor(median))) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Year:\", year),\n      x = \"Province\",\n      y = \"Drug Cases Per Km^2\",\n      fill = \"Cluster\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n  # Store the plot in the list\n  plot_list[[as.character(year)]] &lt;- plot\n}\n\n# Combine all the bar charts into a 3x2 layout\ncombined_plot &lt;- wrap_plots(plot_list, ncol = 3)\n\n# Print the combined plot\nprint(combined_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series of bar charts shows drug case density per Km² by province from 2017 to 2022, with clusters categorized as:\n\nHigh-High (blue/purple): High drug case density both within the province and surrounding areas.\nHigh-Low (green): High density in the province but low in neighboring regions.\nLow-Low (red): Low density both in the province and its surroundings.\n\nKey Trends:\n\nConsistent Urban Hotspots:\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan, and Nonthaburi maintain High-High clusters throughout the years, indicating ongoing drug-related challenges in these urban areas.\n\nEmerging Shifts in 2022:\n\nA new purple color cluster emerges, suggesting shifts in clustering methods or data focus in 2022. Non-urban areas, such as Phuket, appear with high density in recent years, hinting at new or growing issues.\n\nStability of Low-Risk Areas:\n\nProvinces like Phichit, Tak, and Uttaradit remain consistently in the Low-Low category, reflecting well-maintained control over drug-related issues.\n\nFluctuating High-Low Clusters:\n\nKhon Kaen and Phrae oscillate between High-Low and Low-Low across the years, indicating instability in drug cases that require periodic monitoring.\n\n\nImplications:\n\nUrban Focus: Consistent high densities in metropolitan areas (Bangkok, Samut Prakan) suggest a need for sustained interventions.\nEmerging Concerns: Newly appearing provinces with significant clusters (e.g., Phuket in 2022) demand attention to prevent escalation.\nMonitoring Trends: Provinces switching between High-Low and Low-Low require close tracking for early interventions.\n\nThis multi-year analysis reveals the importance of tailored, region-specific strategies, with particular attention on urban centers and monitoring of new risk areas over time."

    "text": "4.4 Creating Exploratory Data Analysis Aggregated Data\nIn this section, we prepare the aggregated data for our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by combining non-spatial drug case data with spatial province data in Thailand. The aim is to create a data frame that includes key variables such as total drug cases, yearly drug cases, province areas, and drug density (cases per square kilometer). Additionally, we will rank provinces based on these metrics for further analysis.\nStep 1: Calculate Province Area\nWe start by calculating the area of each province in square kilometers using the spatial geometry data. The areas are then stored as numeric values, and the geometry column is dropped from the data frame to focus on non-spatial attributes.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province %&gt;%\n  mutate(Area_km2 = as.numeric(st_area(.) / 1e6)) %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry()\n\nThis gives us the area of each province, which is necessary for calculating drug case density (cases per square kilometer).\nStep 2: Aggregate Total Drug Cases per Province\nNext, we calculate the total number of drug cases for each province by grouping the data. The total cases are then merged with the province area data to prepare for further analysis.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thai_drug_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Province) %&gt;%\n  summarise(TotalCases = sum(Cases), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  left_join(thailand_province_df, by = \"Province\")  # Join with the spatial data (Area_km2)\n\nStep 3: Pivot Yearly Data into Wide Format\nWe pivot the yearly drug case data to create a column for each year, allowing us to store yearly drug case information in a wide format. This is useful for calculating yearly density and rankings.\n\ndrug_cases_by_year &lt;- thai_drug_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Province, Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(YearlyCases = sum(Cases), .groups = 'drop') %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = YearlyCases, names_prefix = \"Cases_\")\n\nStep 4: Merge Yearly Cases with Province Data\nWe merge the yearly drug case data with the existing province-level data to include both total cases and yearly cases in the same data frame.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  left_join(drug_cases_by_year, by = \"Province\")\n\nStep 5: Ensure Yearly Data Columns are Numeric\nTo facilitate further calculations, we ensure that all the yearly case columns are numeric, as they will be used in density calculations and rankings.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"Cases_\"), as.numeric))\n\nStep 6: Calculate Total and Yearly Drug Density\nWe calculate the total drug case density (cases per square kilometer) by dividing the total number of drug cases by the area of each province. Similarly, we calculate yearly drug density for each year.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(TotalDensity = TotalCases / Area_km2)\n\n# Yearly drug density calculation (create new columns for each year)\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(starts_with(\"Cases_\"), \n                ~ .x / Area_km2, \n                .names = \"Density_{.col}\"))\n\nStep 7: Rank Provinces by Total Cases, Density, and Yearly Cases\nWe generate rankings for provinces based on total drug cases, total drug density, and yearly drug cases and their respective densities. We use the dense_rank function, which assigns ranks while skipping gaps.\n\nyears &lt;- c(\"Cases_2017\", \"Cases_2018\", \"Cases_2019\", \"Cases_2020\", \"Cases_2021\", \"Cases_2022\")\n\n# Rank TotalCases and TotalDensity using dense_rank\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(Rank_TotalCases = dense_rank(-TotalCases),  # Rank descending by TotalCases\n         Rank_TotalDensity = dense_rank(-TotalDensity))  # Rank descending by TotalDensity\n\n# Rank for each year's cases and density using dense_rank\nfor (year in years) {\n  thailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n    mutate(!!paste0(\"Rank_\", year) := dense_rank(-get(year))) %&gt;%  # Rank yearly cases with dense_rank\n    mutate(!!paste0(\"Rank_Density_\", year) := dense_rank(-get(paste0(\"Density_\", year))))  # Rank yearly density with dense_rank\n}\n\nStep 8: Rename Columns for Consistency\nWe rename the columns for better readability and consistency, making sure all relevant metrics (cases, density, and ranks) are properly labeled.\n\nthailand_province_df &lt;- thailand_province_df %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~ gsub(\"^Cases_\", \"Drugs_Cases_\", .x), starts_with(\"Cases_\")) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~ gsub(\"^Density_Cases_\", \"Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_\", .x), starts_with(\"Density_Cases_\")) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~ gsub(\"^Rank_Cases_\", \"Rank_No_Drug_Cases_\", .x), starts_with(\"Rank_Cases_\")) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~ gsub(\"^Rank_Density_Cases_\", \"Rank_No_Drug_Cases_Per_Km2_\", .x), starts_with(\"Rank_Density_Cases_\"))\n\nStep 9: Final Data Overview\nWe now have a comprehensive data frame that includes:\n\nTotal and yearly drug cases\nProvince area\nDrug case density (total and yearly)\nRankings for cases and density\n\nThis data frame will serve as the foundation for further analysis, visualizations, and insights related to drug-related incidents across Thailand.\n\nhead(thailand_province_df)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 30\n  Province      TotalCases Area_km2 Drugs_Cases_2017 Drugs_Cases_2018\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 AMNAT CHAROEN      11695    3291.             1734             2038\n2 ANG THONG           3487     944.              208              660\n3 BANGKOK            65522    1571.            11871            16480\n4 BUENG KAN           8921    4013.              900              824\n5 BURI RAM           16294   10096.             1265             2746\n6 CHACHOENGSAO       15516    5171.             2534             2199\n# ℹ 25 more variables: Drugs_Cases_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;, TotalDensity &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2017 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Rank_TotalCases &lt;int&gt;, Rank_TotalDensity &lt;int&gt;,\n#   Rank_No_Drug_Cases_2017 &lt;int&gt;, Rank_No_Drug_Cases_Per_Km2_2017 &lt;int&gt;, …\n\n\nStep 10: Merge Data Back with Geometry for Mapping\nNow that we have all the calculated data (cases, densities, and ranks), we merge this modified data frame back with the spatial geometry so that it can be used in mapping and further spatial analysis.\n\n# Merge the modified data (thailand_province_df) back with the geometry\nthailand_province_final &lt;- thailand_province %&gt;%\n  left_join(thailand_province_df, by = \"Province\")  # Merge on the 'Province' column\n\n\nthailand_province_final &lt;- thailand_province_final %&gt;%\n  st_simplify(dTolerance = 1000.0)  # Increase the tolerance value"

    "text": "6.1 Global Moran’s I for Aggregated Data Total\nIn this section, we calculate Global Moran’s I for the aggregated data on drug cases, which combines data from 2017 to 2022. By aggregating drug cases over these years, we aim to uncover whether provinces with high or low drug case numbers are spatially clustered over the entire study period. This analysis provides an overview of whether there is a persistent spatial pattern in the clustering of drug cases, allowing us to determine whether certain provinces consistently experience higher or lower concentrations of drug activity over time.\n\n6.1.1 Setting Queen Contiguity and Setting Neighbors\nTo compute Moran’s I, it is crucial to establish the spatial relationships between Thailand’s provinces. For this analysis, we use Queen’s contiguity, where two provinces are considered neighbors if they share either a boundary or a corner point. The next step involves calculating the neighbors for each province, which will define their spatial relationship with surrounding regions.\n\n# Ensure geometries are valid\ninvalid_geometries &lt;- !st_is_valid(thailand_province_final)\ncat(\"Invalid geometries: \", sum(invalid_geometries), \"\\n\")\n\nInvalid geometries:  0 \n\n# Fix invalid geometries (if any)\nthailand_province_final &lt;- st_make_valid(thailand_province_final)\n\n# Generate Queen's contiguity neighbors using sfdep\nnb_queen &lt;- st_contiguity(thailand_province_final, queen = TRUE)\n\n# Check if there are any provinces where the neighbor list contains only the value 0\nempty_neighbors &lt;- which(sapply(nb_queen, function(x) length(x) == 1 && x[[1]] == 0))\n\n# Print the indices of the provinces with no neighbors\ncat(\"Indices of provinces with no valid neighbors: \", empty_neighbors, \"\\n\")\n\nIndices of provinces with no valid neighbors:  67 \n\n# If there are any provinces with no valid neighbors, print their names using the correct index\nif (length(empty_neighbors) &gt; 0) {\n    cat(\"Provinces with no valid neighbors: \", thailand_province_final$Province[empty_neighbors], \"\\n\")\n} else {\n    cat(\"All provinces have valid neighbors.\\n\")\n}\n\nProvinces with no valid neighbors:  PHUKET \n\n\nSome provinces, such as Phuket (an island), do not have natural neighbors, so we manually assign neighboring provinces (e.g., Krabi and Phangnga) to ensure that each province is represented in the analysis. This step is essential to accurately compute spatial weights, which are required to calculate the Moran’s I statistic and identify potential clustering of drug cases across Thailand’s provinces.\n\n# Manually assign neighbors for Phuket (index 67), Krabi (index 65), and Phangnga (index 66)\n# Ensure the indices are integers\nnb_queen[[67]] &lt;- as.integer(c(65, 66))  # Convert to integers\n\n# Create weight matrix based on the neighbors\nwt_queen &lt;- st_weights(nb_queen, style = \"W\")\n\n# Add neighbors and weight matrix back to the thailand_province_final_sf object\nthailand_province_final_sf &lt;- thailand_province_final %&gt;%\n  mutate(nb = nb_queen, wt = wt_queen)\n\n# Check if there are any provinces where the neighbor list contains only the value 0\nempty_neighbors &lt;- which(sapply(nb_queen, function(x) length(x) == 1 && x[[1]] == 0))\n\n# Print the indices of the provinces with no neighbors\ncat(\"Indices of provinces with no valid neighbors: \", empty_neighbors, \"\\n\")\n\nIndices of provinces with no valid neighbors:   \n\n# If there are any provinces with no valid neighbors, print their names using the correct index\nif (length(empty_neighbors) &gt; 0) {\n  cat(\"Provinces with no valid neighbors: \", thailand_province_final$Province[empty_neighbors], \"\\n\")\n} else {\n  cat(\"All provinces have valid neighbors.\\n\")\n}\n\nAll provinces have valid neighbors.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Getting Global’s Moran I\nIn this section, we are calculating the Global Moran’s I statistic to measure the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the aggregated drug case data across Thailand’s provinces. This statistic helps us understand whether provinces with similar numbers of drug cases are clustered together or dispersed across the region. To conduct this analysis, we rely on spatial weights based on Queen’s contiguity, which captures the spatial relationships between provinces.\nThe steps include:\n\nGlobal Moran’s I calculation: We calculate Global Moran’s I using the total number of drug cases across all provinces. The spatial relationships (neighbors) and spatial weights are used to determine the level of autocorrelation.\nPermutation test: To validate the significance of the Moran’s I statistic, we perform a permutation test with 1000 simulations. This tests whether the observed Moran’s I value is statistically significant or if the observed spatial clustering could have occurred by chance.\n\nThe code below performs the calculation and checks the structure of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy Use Density Instead of Total Cases?\nUsing density normalizes drug cases by population or area, allowing for fairer comparisons between regions. Total cases alone can mislead, as larger provinces naturally have more cases due to size. Density highlights areas with higher concentrations of drug cases, providing a clearer, more accurate analysis of hotspots, regardless of region size.\n\n\n\n# Global Moran's I for TotalCases\nglobal_moranI_total &lt;- global_moran(thailand_province_final_sf$TotalDensity, thailand_province_final_sf$nb, thailand_province_final_sf$wt)\n# Perform Permutation test for TotalCases\nglobal_moranI_total_perm_test &lt;- global_moran_perm(thailand_province_final_sf$TotalDensity, thailand_province_final_sf$nb, thailand_province_final_sf$wt, nsim = 999)\n\n# Check the structure of the result\nprint(global_moranI_total)\n\n$I\n[1] 0.3379632\n\n$K\n[1] 37.1161\n\nprint(global_moranI_total_perm_test)\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  x \nweights: listw  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.33796, observed rank = 1000, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n\n\n\nThe global_moran() function calculates the Moran’s I statistic for the total drug cases based on the defined spatial relationships and weights.\nThe global_moran_perm() function performs a permutation test with 1000 random simulations to determine whether the observed Moran’s I value is significant.\nFinally, we print the results to review the Moran’s I value and assess its significance based on the permutation test output.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Analysis and Interpretation\nThe histogram helps visualize the distribution of simulated Moran’s I values from the permutation test. By comparing the observed Moran’s I (red line) to this distribution, we can quickly assess how unusual or significant the observed spatial autocorrelation is.\n\nhist(global_moranI_total_perm_test$res, breaks = 20, main = \"Permutation Distribution of Moran's I\", \n     xlab = \"Simulated Moran's I Values\", col = \"lightblue\")\nabline(v = global_moranI_total_perm_test$statistic, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Observed Moran's I\"), col = c(\"red\"), lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the Global Moran’s I statistic and the Monte Carlo permutation test provide insight into the spatial autocorrelation of drug cases across Thailand’s provinces. Let’s break down the results and further analyze the implications.\n\nInterpretation of the Moran’s I Value: The Moran’s I value is 0.315, which indicates moderate positive spatial autocorrelation. This means provinces with similar numbers of drug cases (whether high or low) tend to cluster together, showing a stronger spatial pattern than random distribution.\nSignificance of the Results (Permutation Test): The Monte Carlo simulation, with 1000 random permutations, gives a p-value of &lt; 2.2e-16, indicating the Moran’s I value is highly significant. The observed rank of 1,000 confirms that none of the random permutations produced a higher Moran’s I value. This strongly supports the presence of spatial clustering in drug cases.\nThe histogram shows that the observed Moran’s I value (in red) is far to the right of the distribution of simulated values, indicating strong spatial autocorrelation. The significant difference between the observed value and the simulated values confirms that the clustering of drug cases is not random, but statistically significant, with a p-value &lt; 2.2e-16.\nImplications and Next Steps: The significant and moderate Moran’s I value suggests that drug cases are not randomly distributed but are spatially clustered across provinces. This finding points to specific areas that may require targeted interventions. Further analysis using local spatial statistics could help identify precise clusters for more effective policy measures."

These simulated p-values help us determine whether observed clusters are significant or could have occurred by random chance. This is especially important when running multiple simulations (in this case, 1000) to ensure the reliability of our results.

Unlike Global Moran’s I, which gives us an overall sense of spatial autocorrelation across the entire dataset, Local Moran’s I zooms in on individual provinces. It reveals whether specific provinces are surrounded by others with similar (high-high or low-low) or dissimilar (high-low or low-high) patterns of drug cases.\n\nHigh-High and Low-Low Clustering\n\nHigh-High Clusters: These are provinces where a high number of drug-related incidents are clustered with neighboring provinces that also have high numbers. This indicates hotspots of drug activity, which are critical for public health officials and policymakers to target interventions. These areas are experiencing a concentrated issue that may require urgent attention, such as increased law enforcement or public health campaigns.\nLow-Low Clusters: On the other hand, low-low clusters occur where provinces with low drug-related incidents are surrounded by others that also report low numbers. These areas are typically not a cause for immediate concern but might reflect regions that could benefit from maintaining current preventive measures.\nHigh-Low and Low-High: These are areas where the province’s drug case count contrasts with its neighbors (e.g., a high number of incidents surrounded by low-incident provinces). These outliers may indicate regions where drug problems are emerging or where prevention strategies are not uniform across regions.\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Statistical Significance (P_ii_sim)\nThe significance value, represented by P_ii_sim, plays a crucial role in determining whether these local clusters are statistically significant or just random noise. In our case, we are considering clusters as significant if their p-value is less than 0.05.\n\nSignificant Clusters: If a cluster is significant, it means that the observed spatial pattern (whether it’s high-high, low-low, etc.) is unlikely to have occurred by chance. These are the clusters that demand the most attention, as they reflect genuine patterns in the spatial distribution of drug cases.\nNon-Significant Clusters: These clusters, on the other hand, may not represent real patterns and could have occurred randomly. They are less important for immediate action and should be interpreted with caution.\n\nBy visualizing both the Local Moran’s I and the corresponding p-values, we can visually assess which provinces exhibit significant spatial patterns of clustering. The side-by-side maps allow us to see:\n\nWhere high-high and low-low clusters are happening (Local Moran’s I map).\nWhich of these clusters are statistically significant (P-value map).\n\nThis combination of local spatial autocorrelation and significance testing helps us prioritize where to focus resources and interventions. It enables policymakers to target areas with strong evidence of clustering and take proactive measures in provinces where drug-related issues are concentrated.\n\nLISA_TotalDensity &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n  mutate(significant = ifelse(p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05, \"Significant\", \"Not Significant\"))\n\n# Set tmap mode to plot\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n# Assuming LISA_TotalDensity is your spatial data frame containing the relevant columns\n\n# Create map for local Moran's I\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +  # Use the spatial data frame\n  tm_fill(\"median\", title = \"Local Moran's I\") +  # Change to the relevant column for local Moran's I\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8)) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Local Moran's I of TotalDensity\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\n# Create map for p-value of local Moran's I\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",  # Change to your p-value column\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\"),\n          title = \"P-Value of Local Moran's I\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"P-Value of Local Moran's I\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\n# Arrange the maps side by side\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe side-by-side maps display the Local Moran’s I clustering (left) and the corresponding p-values for significance (right) of drug-related incidents across provinces in Thailand.\nOn the Local Moran’s I map, we can observe areas of high-high clustering, such as in the eastern regions, indicating provinces where drug cases are concentrated and surrounded by similarly affected provinces. Conversely, low-low clusters, seen in some northern and southern regions, suggest areas with low drug case densities surrounded by similarly low-density provinces. There are also some high-low and low-high outliers, which might represent emerging drug-related issues or unusual distribution patterns.\nHowever, the P-value map reveals that many of these clusters are marked as not significant (in darker orange). This suggests that although spatial patterns appear in the Local Moran’s I map, they may not be statistically significant. To focus the analysis on reliable clusters, it would be useful to filter out these non-significant areas and concentrate only on the significant clusters (those with p-values below 0.05), which will provide a clearer picture of where interventions are truly needed.\nBy filtering out the non-significant areas, we can better prioritize the regions where statistically significant spatial clustering of drug cases occurs, allowing for more targeted and data-driven policy measures.\n\n# Set tmap mode to view for interactive mapping\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\n# Filter significant local Moran's I results\nLISA_TotalDensity_Sig &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n  filter(p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05)\n\n# Create the map\nmap &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity_Sig) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6,8)) +\n  tm_fill(\"median\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4)\n\n# Print the map\nprint(map)\n\nWarning: One tm layer group has duplicated layer types, which are omitted. To\ndraw multiple layers of the same type, use multiple layer groups (i.e. specify\ntm_shape prior to each of them).\n\n\nThis map highlights the significant clusters of Local Moran’s I after filtering out the non-significant regions. The provinces that remain on this map are those where the spatial clustering of drug-related incidents is statistically significant, meaning that these areas demonstrate true spatial patterns that are not likely to have occurred by chance.\n\nChiang Mai and a few neighboring provinces in the north exhibit low-low clustering (green), suggesting these regions have lower densities of drug-related cases and are surrounded by similarly low-case provinces. This could indicate effective control measures or a less severe drug issue in this part of the country.\nBangkok and surrounding provinces (in red) show high-high clustering, indicating that these areas are experiencing significantly higher concentrations of drug-related cases, and they are surrounded by similarly affected provinces. These regions are likely hotspots and would be priority areas for intervention strategies, such as increased law enforcement or public health outreach.\nA few provinces in the northeastern and northern regions (yellow) display low-high clusters, where relatively low case densities are adjacent to provinces with higher case densities. These areas could represent transitional zones or emerging problem areas, which may require monitoring to prevent future escalation.\n\nThis focused map allows policymakers to concentrate on the most critical regions, ensuring that resources are directed to areas where drug-related clustering is a statistically significant concern."

    "text": "7.3 Conclusion\nThe 3x2 grid of maps showcases the significant clusters of Local Moran’s I across the years 2017 to 2022, highlighting where drug-related incidents have shown consistent spatial clustering over time. Here’s the key analysis based on the visualization:\nConsistent Clustering Patterns:\n\nBangkok and surrounding areas have consistently shown high-high clustering across all years from 2017 to 2022. This suggests that this region remains a persistent hotspot for drug-related incidents, indicating that the problem has not been mitigated over time. The significance of these clusters each year emphasizes the importance of sustained intervention in these regions.\nNorthern and central provinces show low-low clustering consistently throughout the years. These provinces have lower drug-related incidents compared to their neighbors, and the stability of this pattern over time suggests that these areas have not experienced a significant increase in drug activity.\n\nPotential Anomalies in 2021:\n\nIn 2021, we observe some slight changes in the clustering patterns, where fewer regions appear significant compared to other years. This could potentially be linked to the effects of COVID-19, where disruptions in law enforcement, reporting, or drug activities might have led to temporary fluctuations in spatial patterns. However, this change seems to be short-lived, as the patterns return to similar levels in 2022.\n\nConcerning Stability of Active Regions:\n\nThe fact that the same provinces (both high-high and low-low) remain significant across multiple years is concerning. This persistence suggests that certain regions have been continuously affected by either a concentration of drug-related problems or consistently low incident rates. For areas showing high-high clustering, this implies a failure to effectively address the issue over time.\n\nPolicy Implications:\nThe lack of significant change in clustering patterns year after year highlights the need for long-term strategies and possibly new approaches to mitigate drug-related incidents in regions like Bangkok and its surrounding areas. Meanwhile, for regions with low-low clustering, efforts should continue to maintain preventive measures, ensuring that these areas remain under control.\nThis analysis underscores the importance of regularly monitoring spatial clustering to track the effectiveness of policy interventions and to identify emerging trends that may require attention."

The use of these inverse-distance weights is important because it reflects how incidents in nearby areas have a greater impact on the clustering of a province.\n\nAfter the neighborhood structure and weights are established, we calculate the Local Gi statistic* to identify local hotspots using the following code:\n\nHCSA_Total &lt;- thailand_idw %&gt;% \n  mutate(local_Gi = local_gstar_perm(\n    TotalDensity, nb, wts, nsim = 999)) %&gt;%\n  unnest(local_Gi)\nHCSA_Total\n\nSimple feature collection with 77 features and 43 fields\nActive geometry column: geometry\nGeometry type: GEOMETRY\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 325178.8 ymin: 620865.7 xmax: 1213656 ymax: 2263213\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / UTM zone 47N\n# A tibble: 77 × 45\n   Province                TotalCases Area_km2 Drugs_Cases_2017 Drugs_Cases_2018\n   &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 BANGKOK                      65522    1571.            11871            16480\n 2 SAMUT PRAKAN                 14721     949.              820             3015\n 3 NONTHABURI                    8881     636.              553             1661\n 4 PATHUM THANI                  9805    1517.              450             1823\n 5 PHRA NAKHON SI AYUTTHA…       8780    2553.              378             1123\n 6 ANG THONG                     3487     944.              208              660\n 7 LOP BURI                      9236    6493.              727             1850\n 8 SING BURI                     2596     818.              127              402\n 9 CHAI NAT                      3781    2485.              200              422\n10 SARABURI                      4229    3483.               69              628\n# ℹ 67 more rows\n# ℹ 40 more variables: Drugs_Cases_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;, TotalDensity &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2017 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2018 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2019 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2020 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2021 &lt;dbl&gt;, Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_2022 &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Rank_TotalCases &lt;int&gt;, Rank_TotalDensity &lt;int&gt;, …\n\n\n\nlocal_Gi Calculation: Here, we are calculating the Local Gi statistic* using a permutation approach (local_gstar_perm). This statistic measures local hotspots and coldspots based on the density of drug cases (TotalDensity) and the spatial relationships (nb and wts). The number of simulations (nsim = 999) ensures that we have a robust estimate of the significance of clustering.\n\nThe local_Gi statistic helps in identifying whether a province is part of a hotspot (higher-than-expected incidents of drug cases) or a coldspot (lower-than-expected incidents). By applying this statistic over multiple time periods, we can track whether hotspots are emerging, dissipating, or remaining stable over time, making this a powerful tool for understanding the evolving nature of drug-related incidents.\nThe results of EHSA, combined with statistical measures like Local Gi*, allow us to visualize which provinces are experiencing significant changes in drug-related activity, helping to inform more timely and localized interventions. This makes it an essential tool for long-term strategic planning in addressing the drug problem in Thailand.\n\n\n8.1.2 Visualising the HotSpot Areas\nTo visualize the results of the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA), we follow a similar process to what we did for Local Moran’s I, but this time we are focusing on the Gi statistic* (also known as Getis-Ord Gi*) and its corresponding p-values.\nThe goal here is to display the hotspots (areas with higher-than-expected drug-related incidents) and coldspots (areas with lower-than-expected incidents) alongside the statistical significance of these patterns, just like in the Local Moran’s I analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy Visualize the Gi* Statistic and p-values?\nBy visualizing both the Gi statistic* and its p-values, we can understand not only where clustering occurs but also which clusters are statistically significant. This allows us to differentiate between areas that may show some clustering patterns but are not significant from those that have a strong statistical basis for further investigation or intervention.\nVisualizing these charts is crucial for understanding which provinces have stable or emerging hotspots of drug activity, helping authorities make informed, data-driven decisions.\n\n\n\n8.1.2.1 Visualizing the Gi* Statistic and p-values\nThe first map (map1) shows the Gi* clustering for density, where the color-coding indicates whether a region is part of a high-high cluster (hotspot) or a low-low cluster (coldspot). The second map (map2) focuses on the p-values, showing which clusters are statistically significant (with a p-value less than 0.05) and thus are more likely to represent real patterns rather than random noise.\n\nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(HCSA_Total) +\n  tm_fill(\"cluster\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6,8)) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Gi* of Density\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(HCSA_Total) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_sim\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n              labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\")) + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"p-value of Gi*\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2 Filtering Out for Significant Clusters\nTo ensure we only focus on meaningful results, we filter the dataset to include only significant clusters (p-values &lt; 0.05) and visualize these clusters again:\n\nHCSA_total_sig &lt;- HCSA_Total %&gt;%\n  filter(p_sim &lt; 0.05)\n\ntm_shape(HCSA_Total) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Significant Clusters of HSCA by Thailand Province\",\n            title.size = 0.8) +  # Add + here\ntm_shape(HCSA_total_sig) +\n  tm_fill(\"cluster\", \n          popup.vars = c(\"Province\" = \"Province\", \"P-Value\" = \"p_sim\", \"Cluster\" = \"cluster\", \"Drug Case Density (Km^2)\" = \"TotalDensity\")) +  # Set popup variables order\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map displays the results of the Emerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA), specifically highlighting the significant clusters of drug-related incidents in Thailand. The regions are color-coded based on whether they represent high or low clusters of drug-related activity:\n\nYellow regions represent high clusters (hotspots), where drug-related incidents are higher than expected. These areas, centered around Bangkok and its surrounding provinces, indicate persistent hotspots of drug activity. This suggests a concentration of drug-related issues that have continued to be significant over time, signaling the need for sustained intervention in these areas.\nGreen regions indicate low clusters (coldspots), where drug-related incidents are lower than expected. These are regions primarily in the northern and central parts of Thailand, where drug activity appears to be under better control compared to the surrounding areas. The consistency of these low clusters suggests that these provinces have relatively fewer drug-related problems and may serve as areas with effective preventive measures.\n\n\n\n8.1.2.3 Analysis On Total Density By Province With Significant clusters.\n\n# Drop geometry, sort by TotalDensity, and select relevant columns\nHCSA_total_sig &lt;- HCSA_total_sig %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # Remove geometry\n  select(Province, p_sim, cluster, TotalDensity) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TotalDensity))  # Sort by TotalDensity\n\n# Create the bar chart\nggplot(HCSA_total_sig, aes(x = reorder(Province, -TotalDensity), y = TotalDensity, fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Drug Case Density by Province with Signficant HSCA Clusters\",\n    x = \"Province\",\n    y = \"Drug Case Density (Km^2)\",\n    fill = \"Cluster\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Total Drug Case Density by Province with Significant HSCA Clusters\nThis chart shows the drug case density (per Km²) by province, with clusters categorized as High (teal) and Low (red), reflecting the HSCA (Hot Spot Cluster Analysis) results.\nKey Observations:\n\nUrban Hotspots (High Cluster):\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan, and Nonthaburi display the highest drug case densities, highlighting persistent drug-related issues in major urban centers.\nThese areas likely face challenges due to population density, social factors, and higher substance availability.\n\nModerate Risk Provinces:\n\nProvinces such as Pathum Thani and Chachoengsao are also in the high cluster but with lower densities compared to Bangkok. They indicate spillover effects from nearby urban areas.\n\nLow Clusters (Red):\n\nSeveral provinces, including Khon Kaen, Phichit, and Uttaradit, show low-density clusters, reflecting fewer drug-related incidents.\nThis suggests these areas have fewer drug problems or effective control measures in place.\n\nDistribution Trend:\n\nThe drug case density drops sharply after the first few high-risk provinces, with most of the remaining provinces showing minimal cases.\n\n\nImplications:\n\nFocused Intervention: Urban areas like Bangkok and surrounding provinces need targeted policies, such as increased monitoring, prevention programs, and rehabilitation efforts.\nPreventive Action in Low-Risk Areas: The low-cluster provinces should continue preventive measures to maintain their low-density status.\nSpillover Monitoring: Moderate-risk provinces (e.g., Pathum Thani) could benefit from monitoring efforts to prevent escalation from neighboring high-risk areas."

This persistent high clustering in central Thailand indicates that drug-related activities remain concentrated in this area. Despite any potential interventions, these regions continue to display significant hotspots, signaling a need for stronger or alternative policies to address this issue.\nLow clusters in northern provinces such as Chiang Mai are also consistent over the years. These areas have maintained a lower-than-expected rate of drug incidents, which could indicate successful long-term preventive measures or generally lower drug-related activities.\n\nEmerging Patterns:\n\nIn 2020, the clustering patterns remain similar to previous years, with no significant changes, suggesting that the drug activity hotspots and coldspots are stable.\nIn 2021, there is some slight variation in the clustering patterns, though the changes are minimal. The continued high clustering in the central provinces emphasizes that the core problem areas have not shifted substantially.\n\nKey Observations:\n\nThe regions around Bangkok remain significant hotspots throughout the six years, indicating that drug-related incidents are entrenched in this area.\nNorthern and central provinces consistently show low clustering, which suggests effective long-term measures or inherently lower drug activities.\nThere are no new emerging hotspots in other regions, suggesting that the drug issue has remained largely concentrated in these identified provinces over time.\n\n\n\n8.2.1.2 Animation across the years ESHA\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n\n# Create an empty list to store individual maps\nmap_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through each year to create maps for significant clusters\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Filter significant clusters for the current year\n  HSCA_Sig &lt;- HCSA_Total %&gt;%\n    filter(!!sym(paste0(\"p_sim_\", year)) &lt; 0.05)  # Filter for significance\n\n  # Create the map for significant clusters for the current year\n  map_HSCA &lt;- tm_shape(HCSA_Total) +\n    tm_polygons() +\n    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n    tm_shape(HSCA_Sig) +\n    tm_fill(paste0(\"cluster_\", year), alpha = 0.7) + \n    tm_borders(col = \"darkblue\", alpha = 0.4) +\n    tm_layout(\n      main.title = paste(\"Significant Clusters of HSCA -\", year),\n      main.title.size = 0.8,\n      legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")\n    ) +\n    tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8))\n\n  # Store the current map in the list\n  map_list[[as.character(year)]] &lt;- map_HSCA\n}\n\n# Create an animated GIF by stitching the maps together\ntmap_animation(\n  map_list,\n  filename = \"HSCA_Animation.gif\",  # Output GIF file\n  delay = 1000,  # Delay between frames in milliseconds (1 second)\n  width = 800, \n  height = 600\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Analysis of the EHSA Maps (2017-2022)\n\n# Define the years\nyears &lt;- 2017:2022\n\n# Create an empty list to store individual bar charts\nplot_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through each year to create a bar chart for significant HSCA clusters\nfor (year in years) {\n  # Filter data for the current year\n  HCSA_Sig &lt;- HCSA_Total %&gt;%\n    st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # Remove geometry column\n    filter(!!sym(paste0(\"p_sim_\", year)) &lt; 0.05) %&gt;%  # Filter significant clusters\n    select(\n      Province,\n      cluster = !!sym(paste0(\"cluster_\", year)),\n      Density = !!sym(paste0(\"Drugs_Cases_Per_Km2_\", year))  # Use year-specific density\n    ) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(Density))  # Sort by that year's density\n\n  # Create a bar chart for the current year\n  plot &lt;- ggplot(HCSA_Sig, aes(x = reorder(Province, -Density), y = Density, fill = as.factor(cluster))) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Year:\", year),\n      x = \"Province\",\n      y = \"Drug Cases Per Km²\",\n      fill = \"Cluster\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n  # Store the plot in the list\n  plot_list[[as.character(year)]] &lt;- plot\n}\n\n# Combine all the bar charts into a 3x2 layout\ncombined_plot &lt;- wrap_plots(plot_list, ncol = 3)\n\n# Print the combined plot\nprint(combined_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series of bar charts shows the drug case density (per Km²) by province across the years 2017-2022, with clusters categorized as:\n\nHigh (teal): Provinces with high drug case density.\nLow (red): Provinces with lower drug case density.\n\nKey Observations:\n\nConsistent Urban Hotspots:\n\nBangkok, Samut Prakan, and Nonthaburi maintain high drug case density across all years.

This is a macro-level measure that tells us whether there is significant spatial autocorrelation in the data as a whole.\nLocal Moran’s I allows us to zoom into specific provinces and examine whether individual regions are part of high-high or low-low clusters. This helps identify specific hotspots or coldspots within the broader trends detected by Global Moran’s I.\nEmerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA) adds a temporal dimension to the analysis, revealing whether hotspots are stable, emerging, or dissipating over time. This allows us to track how patterns change across years and identify regions where drug-related issues are growing."

These simulated p-values help us determine whether observed clusters are significant or could have occurred by random chance. This is especially important when running multiple simulations (in this case, 1000) to ensure the reliability of our results.

Unlike Global Moran’s I, which gives us an overall sense of spatial autocorrelation across the entire dataset, Local Moran’s I zooms in on individual provinces. It reveals whether specific provinces are surrounded by others with similar (high-high or low-low) or dissimilar (high-low or low-high) patterns of drug cases.\nHigh-High and Low-Low Clustering\n\nHigh-High Clusters: These are provinces where a high number of drug-related incidents are clustered with neighboring provinces that also have high numbers. This indicates hotspots of drug activity, which are critical for public health officials and policymakers to target interventions. These areas are experiencing a concentrated issue that may require urgent attention, such as increased law enforcement or public health campaigns.\nLow-Low Clusters: On the other hand, low-low clusters occur where provinces with low drug-related incidents are surrounded by others that also report low numbers. These areas are typically not a cause for immediate concern but might reflect regions that could benefit from maintaining current preventive measures.\nHigh-Low and Low-High: These are areas where the province’s drug case count contrasts with its neighbors (e.g., a high number of incidents surrounded by low-incident provinces). These outliers may indicate regions where drug problems are emerging or where prevention strategies are not uniform across regions.\n\nThe Importance of Statistical Significance (P_ii_sim)\nThe significance value, represented by P_ii_sim, plays a crucial role in determining whether these local clusters are statistically significant or just random noise. In our case, we are considering clusters as significant if their p-value is less than 0.05.\n\nSignificant Clusters: If a cluster is significant, it means that the observed spatial pattern (whether it’s high-high, low-low, etc.) is unlikely to have occurred by chance. These are the clusters that demand the most attention, as they reflect genuine patterns in the spatial distribution of drug cases.\nNon-Significant Clusters: These clusters, on the other hand, may not represent real patterns and could have occurred randomly. They are less important for immediate action and should be interpreted with caution.\n\nBy visualizing both the Local Moran’s I and the corresponding p-values, we can visually assess which provinces exhibit significant spatial patterns of clustering. The side-by-side maps allow us to see:\n\nWhere high-high and low-low clusters are happening (Local Moran’s I map).\nWhich of these clusters are statistically significant (P-value map).\n\nThis combination of local spatial autocorrelation and significance testing helps us prioritize where to focus resources and interventions. It enables policymakers to target areas with strong evidence of clustering and take proactive measures in provinces where drug-related issues are concentrated.\n\nLISA_TotalDensity &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n  mutate(significant = ifelse(p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05, \"Significant\", \"Not Significant\"))\n\n# Create map for local Moran's \nmap1 &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +  # Use the spatial data frame\n  tm_fill(\"median\", title = \"Local Moran's I\") +  # Change to the relevant column for local Moran's I\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6, 8)) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Local Moran's I of TotalDensity\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\n# Create map for p-value of local Moran's I\nmap2 &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n  tm_fill(\"p_ii_sim\",  # Change to your p-value column\n          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),\n          labels = c(\"0.001\", \"0.01\", \"0.05\", \"Not sig\"),\n          title = \"P-Value of Local Moran's I\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"P-Value of Local Moran's I\",\n            main.title.size = 0.8)\n\n# Arrange the maps side by side\ntmap_arrange(map1, map2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe side-by-side maps display the Local Moran’s I clustering (left) and the corresponding p-values for significance (right) of drug-related incidents across provinces in Thailand.\nOn the Local Moran’s I map, we can observe areas of high-high clustering, such as in the eastern regions, indicating provinces where drug cases are concentrated and surrounded by similarly affected provinces. Conversely, low-low clusters, seen in some northern and southern regions, suggest areas with low drug case densities surrounded by similarly low-density provinces. There are also some high-low and low-high outliers, which might represent emerging drug-related issues or unusual distribution patterns.\nHowever, the P-value map reveals that many of these clusters are marked as not significant (in darker orange). This suggests that although spatial patterns appear in the Local Moran’s I map, they may not be statistically significant. To focus the analysis on reliable clusters, it would be useful to filter out these non-significant areas and concentrate only on the significant clusters (those with p-values below 0.05), which will provide a clearer picture of where interventions are truly needed.\nBy filtering out the non-significant areas, we can better prioritize the regions where statistically significant spatial clustering of drug cases occurs, allowing for more targeted and data-driven policy measures.\n\n# Filter significant local Moran's I results\nLISA_TotalDensity_Sig &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity %&gt;%\n  filter(p_ii_sim &lt; 0.05)\n\n# Create the map\nmap &lt;- tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_shape(LISA_TotalDensity_Sig) +\n  tm_view(set.zoom.limits = c(6,8)) +\n  tm_fill(\"median\", \n          popup.vars = c(\"Province\" = \"Province\", \"P-value\" = \"p_ii_sim\", \"Cluster\" = \"median\",\"Drug Case Density (Km^2)\" = \"TotalDensity\")) +  # Corrected popup.vars\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4) +\n  tm_layout(title=\"Drug Use Per Density of Thailand Province with Significant Clusters\")\n\n# Print the map\nmap\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map highlights the significant clusters of Local Moran’s I after filtering out the non-significant regions. The provinces that remain on this map are those where the spatial clustering of drug-related incidents is statistically significant, meaning that these areas demonstrate true spatial patterns that are not likely to have occurred by chance.\n\nChiang Mai and a few neighboring provinces in the north exhibit low-low clustering (green), suggesting these regions have lower densities of drug-related cases and are surrounded by similarly low-case provinces. This could indicate effective control measures or a less severe drug issue in this part of the country.\nBangkok and surrounding provinces (in red) show high-high clustering, indicating that these areas are experiencing significantly higher concentrations of drug-related cases, and they are surrounded by similarly affected provinces. These regions are likely hotspots and would be priority areas for intervention strategies, such as increased law enforcement or public health outreach.\nA few provinces in the northeastern and northern regions (yellow) display low-high clusters, where relatively low case densities are adjacent to provinces with higher case densities. These areas could represent transitional zones or emerging problem areas, which may require monitoring to prevent future escalation.\n\nThis focused map allows policymakers to concentrate on the most critical regions, ensuring that resources are directed to areas where drug-related clustering is a statistically significant concern.\n\n\n7.1.3 Analysis On Province with Signifcant Clusters\n\n# Drop the geometry and keep only the relevant columns\nLISA_TotalDensity_Sig_Table &lt;- LISA_TotalDensity_Sig %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%  # This removes the geometry column\n  select(Province, p_ii_sim, median, TotalDensity)  # Select the required columns\n\n# Print the resulting table\n# Create the bar chart\nggplot(LISA_TotalDensity_Sig_Table, aes(x = reorder(Province, -TotalDensity), y = TotalDensity, fill = as.factor(median))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Drug Case Density by Province with Clusters\",\n    x = \"Province\",\n    y = \"Drug Case Density (Km^2)\",\n    fill = \"Cluster\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart visualizes Drug Case Density (Km²) by Province, with clusters categorized as High-High (blue), High-Low (green), and Low-Low (red).\nKey Insights:\n\nUrban Hotspots (High-High):\n\nProvinces like Bangkok, Samut Prakan, and Nonthaburi exhibit the highest drug case densities, suggesting a concentration of drug-related issues in highly urbanized areas.\n\nLocalized Issues (High-Low):\n\nKhon Kaen and Phrae show elevated drug cases despite being surrounded by lower-risk areas, indicating potential localized problems or emerging threats.\n\nWidespread Low Risk (Low-Low):\n\nMost provinces (e.g., Phichit, Uttaradit, Tak) report low drug case density, reflecting minimal or well-controlled drug-related activities.\n\n\nImplications:\n\nTargeted Interventions: Focus efforts in Bangkok and neighboring urban areas to address high-risk zones.\nMonitoring Emerging Issues: Keep an eye on High-Low clusters to prevent escalation in localized areas.\nPreventive Measures: Maintain efforts in Low-Low provinces to sustain low drug activity levels.\n\nThis chart underscores the need for geographically tailored strategies, with a stronger focus on urban centers and potential early interventions in emerging high-risk areas."

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on how to delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data. There are two major analysis, namely:\n\nhierarchical cluster analysis; and\nspatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will able:\n\nto convert GIS polygon data into R’s simple feature data.frame by using appropriate functions of sf package of R;\nto convert simple feature data.frame into R’s SpatialPolygonDataFrame object by using appropriate sf of package of R;\nto perform custer analysis by using hclust() of Base R;\nto perform spatially constrained cluster analysis using skater() of Base R; and\nto visualise the analysis output by using ggplot2 and tmap package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn geobusiness and spatial policy, it is a common practice to delineate the market or planning area into homogeneous regions by using multivariate data. In this hands-on exercise, we are interested to delineate Shan State, Myanmar into homogeneous regions by using multiple Information and Communication technology (ICT) measures, namely: Radio, Television, Land line phone, Mobile phone, Computer, and Internet at home.\n\n\n\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this study. They are:\n\nMyanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e. myanmar_township_boundaries) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.\nShan-ICT.csv: This is an extract of The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar at the township level.\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.\nThe R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:\n\nSpatial data handling\n\nsf, rgdal and spdep\n\nAttribute data handling\n\ntidyverse, especially readr, ggplot2 and dplyr\n\nChoropleth mapping\n\ntmap\n\nMultivariate data visualisation and analysis\n\ncoorplot, ggpubr, and heatmaply\n\nCluster analysis\n\ncluster\nClustGeo\n\n\nThe code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, \n               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,\n               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse, GGally)\n\nNote: With tidyverse, we do not have to install readr, ggplot2 and dplyr packages separately. In fact, tidyverse also installs other very useful R packages such as tidyr.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will import Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data and its associated attrbiute table into R environment.\nThe Myanmar Township Boundary GIS data is in ESRI shapefile format. It will be imported into R environment by using the st_read() function of sf.\nThe code chunks used are shown below:\n\nshan_sf &lt;- st_read(dsn = \"data/geospatial\", \n                   layer = \"myanmar_township_boundaries\") %&gt;%\n  filter(ST %in% c(\"Shan (East)\", \"Shan (North)\", \"Shan (South)\")) %&gt;%\n  select(c(2:7))\n\nReading layer `myanmar_township_boundaries' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\jiale\\Desktop\\IS415\\IS415-GAA\\Hands_On_Exercises\\Hands_On_Exercise_9\\data\\geospatial' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 330 features and 14 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 92.17275 ymin: 9.671252 xmax: 101.1699 ymax: 28.54554\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nThe imported township boundary object is called shan_sf.

The boxplot confirms the presence of at least one outlier and indicates that the data might not be perfectly symmetrical, with some values extending further towards the higher range. This suggests that while most observations are within a typical range, there are a few exceptionally high values worth investigating further.\n\n\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plotted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the ict_derived data.frame.\n\nradio &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ntv &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `TV_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nllphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `LLPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nmphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `MPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ncomputer &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `COMPUTER_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ninternet &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `INTERNET_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\nggarrange(radio, tv, llphone, mphone, computer, internet, \n          ncol = 3, \n          nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to combine both the geospatial data object (i.e. shan_sf) and aspatial data.frame object (i.e. ict_derived) into one. This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nthe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the two maps?\nKey Differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\n1st Code Block (tmap_arrange)\n2nd Code Block (tm_facets)\n\n\n\n\nLayout\nTwo independent maps side-by-side\nSynchronized maps in facets\n\n\nInteractivity\nNo interaction between maps\nMaps share zoom and pan behavior\n\n\nLegends\nSeparate for each map\nSingle, unified legend placement\n\n\nCode Complexity\nRequires creating individual maps\nSingle map object with multiple facets\n\n\nUse Case\nGood for static side-by-side comparison\nIdeal for interactive exploration\n\n\n\nWhen to Use Which?\n\ntmap_arrange(): Use when you want two independent maps for comparison, each with its own settings and legends.\ntm_facets(): Use when you need synchronized maps with a unified experience, such as for interactive dashboards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we perform cluster analysis, it is important for us to ensure that the cluster variables are not highly correlated.\nIn this section, you will learn how to use corrplot.mixed() function of corrplot package to visualise and analyse the correlation of the input variables.\n\ncluster_vars.cor = cor(ict_derived[,12:17])\ncorrplot.mixed(cluster_vars.cor,\n         lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation plot above shows that COMPUTER_PR and INTERNET_PR are highly correlated. This suggest that only one of them should be used in the cluster analysis instead of both.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform hierarchical cluster analysis.

Raw Values without Standardization (Left Histogram):\n\nThe distribution of the raw values is right-skewed, with more observations concentrated towards the lower values and fewer observations at the higher end (above 400).\nThe spread is large, with values ranging between 0 and 500, suggesting that the raw data may contain large variability or outliers.\n\n2. Min-Max Standardization (Center Histogram):\n\nMin-Max standardization scales the data to a range between 0 and 1.\nThe shape of the distribution remains similar to the original (right-skewed), but the values are now confined within the standardized range.\nThis transformation preserves the relative spacing between data points but makes it easier to compare across datasets that might have different ranges.\n\n3. Z-Score Standardization (Right Histogram):\n\nZ-score standardization centers the data around a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\nThe distribution is now scaled such that most values fall between -2 and 2.\nThe shape of the distribution is again maintained, but this transformation highlights how far observations deviate from the mean, making it easier to detect outliers or extreme values (e.g., the rightmost bar suggests potential outliers).\n\n\n\n\n\nr &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Raw values without standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_s_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)\ns &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Min-Max Standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_z_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)\nz &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Z-score Standardisation\")\n\nggarrange(r, s, z,\n          ncol = 3,\n          nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, many packages provide functions to calculate distance matrix. We will compute the proximity matrix by using dist() of R.\ndist() supports six distance proximity calculations, they are: euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary and minkowski. The default is euclidean proximity matrix.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the proximity matrix using euclidean method.\n\nproxmat &lt;- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')\n\nThe code chunk

The boxplot confirms the presence of at least one outlier and indicates that the data might not be perfectly symmetrical, with some values extending further towards the higher range. This suggests that while most observations are within a typical range, there are a few exceptionally high values worth investigating further.\n\n\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plotted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the ict_derived data.frame.\n\nradio &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ntv &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `TV_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nllphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `LLPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\nmphone &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `MPHONE_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ncomputer &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `COMPUTER_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\ninternet &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `INTERNET_PR`)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\")\n\n\nggarrange(radio, tv, llphone, mphone, computer, internet, \n          ncol = 3, \n          nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can prepare the choropleth map, we need to combine both the geospatial data object (i.e. shan_sf) and aspatial data.frame object (i.e. ict_derived) into one. This will be performed by using the left_join function of dplyr package. The shan_sf simple feature data.frame will be used as the base data object and the ict_derived data.frame will be used as the join table.\nThe code chunks below is used to perform the task. The unique identifier used to join both data objects is TS_PCODE.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- left_join(shan_sf, \n                     ict_derived, by=c(\"TS_PCODE\"=\"TS_PCODE\"))\n  \nwrite_rds(shan_sf, \"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\nthe message above shows that TS_CODE field is the common field used to perform the left-join.\nIt is important to note that there is no new output data been created. Instead, the data fields from ict_derived data frame are now updated into the data frame of shan_sf.\n\nshan_sf &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/shan_sf.rds\")\n\n\n\n\nTo have a quick look at the distribution of Radio penetration rate of Shan State at township level, a choropleth map will be prepared.\nThe code chunks below are used to prepare the choroplethby using the qtm() function of tmap package.\n\nqtm(shan_sf, \"RADIO_PR\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reveal the distribution shown in the choropleth map above are bias to the underlying total number of households at the townships, we will create two choropleth maps, one for the total number of households (i.e. TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map) and one for the total number of household with Radio (RADIO.map) by using the code chunk below.\n\nTT_HOUSEHOLDS.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\", \n          title = \"Total households\") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\nRADIO.map &lt;- tm_shape(shan_sf) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"RADIO\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\",\n          title = \"Number Radio \") + \n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) \n\ntmap_arrange(TT_HOUSEHOLDS.map, RADIO.map,\n             asp=NA, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth maps above clearly show that townships with relatively larger number ot households are also showing relatively higher number of radio ownership.\nNow let us plot the choropleth maps showing the dsitribution of total number of households and Radio penetration rate by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(shan_sf) +\n    tm_polygons(c(\"TT_HOUSEHOLDS\", \"RADIO_PR\"),\n                style=\"jenks\") +\n    tm_facets(sync = TRUE, ncol = 2) +\n  tm_legend(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))+\n  tm_layout(outer.margins=0, asp=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the two maps?\nKey Differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\n1st Code Block (tmap_arrange)\n2nd Code Block (tm_facets)\n\n\n\n\nLayout\nTwo independent maps side-by-side\nSynchronized maps in facets\n\n\nInteractivity\nNo interaction between maps\nMaps share zoom and pan behavior\n\n\nLegends\nSeparate for each map\nSingle, unified legend placement\n\n\nCode Complexity\nRequires creating individual maps\nSingle map object with multiple facets\n\n\nUse Case\nGood for static side-by-side comparison\nIdeal for interactive exploration\n\n\n\nWhen to Use Which?\n\ntmap_arrange(): Use when you want two independent maps for comparison, each with its own settings and legends.\ntm_facets(): Use when you need synchronized maps with a unified experience, such as for interactive dashboards."

Raw Values without Standardization (Left Histogram):\n\nThe distribution of the raw values is right-skewed, with more observations concentrated towards the lower values and fewer observations at the higher end (above 400).\nThe spread is large, with values ranging between 0 and 500, suggesting that the raw data may contain large variability or outliers.\n\n2. Min-Max Standardization (Center Histogram):\n\nMin-Max standardization scales the data to a range between 0 and 1.\nThe shape of the distribution remains similar to the original (right-skewed), but the values are now confined within the standardized range.\nThis transformation preserves the relative spacing between data points but makes it easier to compare across datasets that might have different ranges.\n\n3. Z-Score Standardization (Right Histogram):\n\nZ-score standardization centers the data around a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\nThe distribution is now scaled such that most values fall between -2 and 2.\nThe shape of the distribution is again maintained, but this transformation highlights how far observations deviate from the mean, making it easier to detect outliers or extreme values (e.g., the rightmost bar suggests potential outliers).\n\n\n\n\n\nr &lt;- ggplot(data=ict_derived, \n             aes(x= `RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Raw values without standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_s_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.std)\ns &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_s_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Min-Max Standardisation\")\n\nshan_ict_z_df &lt;- as.data.frame(shan_ict.z)\nz &lt;- ggplot(data=shan_ict_z_df, \n       aes(x=`RADIO_PR`)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"black\",\n               fill=\"light blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Z-score Standardisation\")\n\nggarrange(r, s, z,\n          ncol = 3,\n          nrow = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, many packages provide functions to calculate distance matrix. We will compute the proximity matrix by using dist() of R.\ndist() supports six distance proximity calculations, they are: euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, binary and minkowski. The default is euclidean proximity matrix.\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the proximity matrix using euclidean method.\n\nproxmat &lt;- dist(shan_ict, method = 'euclidean')\n\nThe code chunk

hierarchical clustering function. In this hands-on exercise, hclust() of R stats will be used.\nhclust() employed agglomeration method to compute the cluster. Eight clustering algorithms are supported, they are: ward.D, ward.D2, single, complete, average(UPGMA), mcquitty(WPGMA), median(WPGMC) and centroid(UPGMC).\nThe code chunk below performs hierarchical cluster analysis using ward.D method. The hierarchical clustering output is stored in an object of class hclust which describes the tree produced by the clustering process.\n\nhclust_ward &lt;- hclust(proxmat, method = 'ward.D')\n\nWe can then plot the tree by using plot() of R Graphics as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(hclust_ward, cex = 0.6)"
