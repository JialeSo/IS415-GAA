Hi Prof,

These are my files for Take Home Exercise 1.

Due to long rendering times both on Netlify and when previewing the Quarto document, I recommend viewing the HTML version for a smoother browser experience. 
The QMD file can be found if you'd like to see the entire workflow, but please note it takes a significant amount of time to render. (20minutes to render, and another 20 minutes to preview)

Directory path to the HTML file:
site -> take_home_exercises -> take_home_exercise_1 -> Take_Home_Exercise1.html

alternatively, you may view it on netlify

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Jiale So.
